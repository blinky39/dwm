# Leon's build of dwm
After 6 hour trying to get FiraCode work, along side with a fallback font to display some cjk character which FiraCode does not support, I try to get font2 patch of `st` work, but It seems that it is completely not working, only the first *char font* works, but font2 is not loding, all my Asian characters are blank in st.
I also tried alacritty, that indeed worked, even I only set FiraCode in alacritty.yaml, I am quietly confussing about how these two behaviour different with each other when loading font.

STFW for about 4 hours still brings me no luck, so finally I yield 😥

I bind MOD+Return to use FiraCode`st -f FiraCode:size=16` and Shift+Returnto use [Hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack) font.
That totally not cool, but... anyway did work...
